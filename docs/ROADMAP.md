# üó∫Ô∏è KFlow Roadmap (Detailed Implementation Plan)

This roadmap outlines the evolution of **KFlow** from concept to production.  
Each phase builds on the previous, integrating technical, design, and AI-driven capabilities.

---

## **Phase 1 ‚Äì Core JSON + Prompt Testing** ‚úÖ  
**Goal:** Establish the foundation of KFlow‚Äôs concept graph system and prompt suite.

### **Objectives**
- Finalize the **minimal JSON schema** used by all operations.  
- Define and test the **nine canonical prompts** for concept generation.  
- Validate **prompt consistency** across multiple topics (e.g., JavaScript, Biology, Math).  
- Create a local simulation pipeline to test merge logic and graph updates.

### **Implementation Steps**
1. **Schema Definition**
   - Use the minimal structure:
     ```json
     {"name": "", "description": "", "parents": [], "children": [], "related": []}
     ```
   - Build merge utility functions:
     - Merge by `name`
     - Union parent/child/related arrays
     - Preserve existing data (avoid overwrite)

2. **Prompt Library**
   - Store all nine prompt templates as `.json` or `.yaml` for easy reuse.  
   - Each prompt should support variable interpolation (e.g., `{{concept_name}}`).

3. **LLM Testing**
   - Call GPT-5 (or GPT-4 Turbo) via API for each operation.
   - Test on multiple subjects (e.g., ‚ÄúMachine Learning,‚Äù ‚ÄúEcology‚Äù).
   - Validate JSON output using schema parsers.

4. **Graph Assembly Script**
   - Parse LLM output and build directed acyclic graph (DAG) in memory.
   - Visualize graph structure using `networkx` or `vis-network`.

### **Deliverables**
- `/prompts` directory containing 9 finalized prompts  
- `/schema/core_schema.json`  
- `/scripts/test_generation.py` (prompt runner and validator)
- Demo concept graph visualized in terminal or local web view

---

## **Phase 2 ‚Äì API + LLM Integration** üîÑ  
**Goal:** Expose KFlow as a backend service that dynamically generates and merges concept nodes.

### **Objectives**
- Implement API endpoints for each operation (expand, synthesize, explore, etc.).
- Integrate LLM API calls with structured JSON validation.
- Store generated nodes in a persistent graph database.
- Enable stateless merging logic on each request.

### **Implementation Steps**
1. **Backend Framework**
   - Use **FastAPI** or **Node.js (Express)** for fast JSON APIs.  
   - Example route:  
     `POST /api/expand` ‚Üí Calls LLM with `expand(concept)` prompt.

2. **LLM Integration**
   - Implement LLM connector (OpenAI SDK, Anthropic, etc.).  
   - Add output validation via `pydantic` or `jsonschema`.

3. **Graph Persistence**
   - Choose storage:  
     - Neo4j for graph queries (ideal for concepts + relationships)  
     - Or PostgreSQL with adjacency lists  
   - Implement merge operations at database level.

4. **Testing**
   - Use `pytest` or Postman for endpoint testing.  
   - Validate concept merge and idempotency (same node = same UUID).

### **Deliverables**
- `/api` folder with routes for all 9 operations  
- Connected graph DB storing generated concepts  
- Postman collection or Swagger docs for testing

## **Phase 3 ‚Äì Mindmap + List UI** üß©  
**Goal:** Build an interactive interface for exploring and manipulating concept graphs.

### **Objectives**
- Design **two synchronized UIs**:  
  - **Mindmap View:** Visual exploration of nodes.  
  - **List View:** Hierarchical learning flow.  
- Implement CRUD operations via UI interactions.  
- Connect frontend to API.

### **Implementation Steps**
1. **Frontend Framework**
   - Use **React** + **TailwindCSS** (for styling) + **shadcn/ui** components.  
   - Manage state using **Zustand** or **Recoil**.

2. **Mindmap View**
   - Integrate **vis-network**, **Cytoscape.js**, or **D3.js**.
   - Each node supports right-click actions (expand, explore, synthesize).
   - Highlight active learning path or attention-weighted nodes.

3. **List View**
   - Hierarchical list grouped by `layer` (accordion style).  
   - Each concept card: title, description, expand/explore buttons, and metadata.  
   - Enable inline operations: ‚ÄúExpand‚Äù, ‚ÄúSynthesize‚Äù, ‚ÄúDerive Parents‚Äù.

4. **Sync Logic**
   - Changes in one view reflect instantly in the other.
   - Use shared state and websocket updates for real-time sync.

5. **UX Enhancements**
   - Smooth transitions when expanding.
   - Highlight ‚Äúfocus‚Äù concepts with glow or border intensity.

### **Deliverables**
- `/frontend` app with dual views  
- Reusable React components: `<ConceptCard />`, `<LayerList />`, `<MindmapGraph />`  
- Real-time interaction between UI and API

---

## **Phase 4 ‚Äì Attention & Validation Engine** ‚è≥  
**Goal:** Introduce adaptive focus and learning validation through embeddings and scoring.

### **Objectives**
- Compute and store **embeddings** for all concepts.  
- Implement **attention weighting** based on user goals.  
- Validate relationships between nodes using similarity measures.

### **Implementation Steps**
1. **Embedding Engine**
   - Use OpenAI `text-embedding-3-large` or similar model.
   - Store vectors in **FAISS** or **Pinecone**.
   - Compute cosine similarity for relationship strength.

2. **Attention Scoring**
   - For user goal (e.g., ‚Äúweb development‚Äù), compute similarity between goal embedding and each node.
   - Normalize to 0‚Äì1 scale for `attention_score`.
   - Tag nodes with `"importance": "low" | "medium" | "high"`.

3. **Validation**
   - Use vector closeness and dependency checks to compute `validation_score`.
   - Highlight weak or missing links in UI.

4. **Dynamic Focus**
   - Visually emphasize high-attention nodes.
   - Allow user to adjust goal, reweight graph in real time.

### **Deliverables**
- `/services/embedding_engine.py`  
- `/models/attention_scorer.py`  
- UI visualization of concept relevance and validation heatmap

---

## **Phase 5 ‚Äì Adaptive Learning & Personalization** üß†  
**Goal:** Build a feedback loop that adapts concept generation and sequencing to individual learners.

### **Objectives**
- Track user interactions (concepts clicked, expanded, ignored).
- Build a simple **learner model** with progress and interests.
- Adapt future generations to skill level and curiosity patterns.

### **Implementation Steps**
1. **User Model**
   - Store profile with fields:
     ```json
     {"user_id": "", "mastered_concepts": [], "interests": [], "attention_history": []}
     ```
   - Continuously update based on usage.

2. **Adaptive Prompting**
   - Modify system prompts dynamically:
     - Adjust concept complexity level.
     - Introduce related areas to reduce pigeonholing.
     - Prioritize unexplored but relevant branches.

3. **Progress Visualization**
   - Display mastery path or knowledge graph heatmap.
   - Show ‚ÄúNext Recommended Concepts‚Äù.

4. **Recommendation Engine**
   - Blend similarity-based retrieval + attention weighting.
   - Suggest optimal next concepts for learning path continuity.

### **Deliverables**
- `/services/adaptive_engine.py`
- `/models/user_profile.py`
- Personalized learning UI (recommendations, milestones, summaries)

## **Final Deliverable: KFlow Platform**

Once all phases are implemented, KFlow will function as a **self-updating, LLM-driven knowledge map** that:
- Evolves dynamically with user interaction.
- Balances exploration and structured progression.
- Adapts to learner goals through attention-guided reasoning.
- Provides APIs for integration with any e-learning platform.
