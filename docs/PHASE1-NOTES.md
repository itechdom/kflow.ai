* should we add levels to make expandList more usefull? since each level would be built on the one before it?
* what should we do with multiple parent concepts? how are they displayed and under what do they get added (last parent? but what if the two parents are on the same layer?).
* synthesize shouldn't rely on the response from the LLM to generate the parents list. it should just keep the parents passed to the operation as the parents.
* synthesize outputs should be confirmed by the user first before adding it to the graph.
